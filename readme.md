# LED-Cube 3D Printing Files

these files are for building the LED-Cube with 160x160mm p2.5 LED panels. 

I labeled the files by what they are needed for and how many you need of them. On the layer 1 and 2 you can choose if you wanna 3D print or if you have access to a CNC mill it out of 3mm alu. If you can mill, I recommend it for following parts:

* 1x Layer 1 

* 1x Layer 2

* 8x Handel 1

* 8x Handel 2

* 6x DC DC Holder (if you going to use LM2596S)

Especially the layers have to hold some load and will deform a little with temperatures above 70° (PLA). The milled aluminum version can also buffer the heat better and it just looks much nicer :)

### To assemble it you need some additional stuff:

In case you've printed everything:

* at least 54x M3 Nuts 2mm high (in case u want to make it ultimate robust - twice that much)
* at least 60x M3x5 Bolts (very-strong-and-a-lot-more-work-to-built-cube - again twice that much)
* a couple M3x10 Bolts… Maybe 22x
* for the hinge:
  * 6x M2.5x14
  * 8x M2.5x18
  * 4x M2.5 self-locking nuts
* 14x M3 inserts
* 12x 10x5x2 neodym magnets



for the milled variant:

* 6x less M3 nuts 
* 6x M3 spacer nuts



and then all the electric stuff…



For printing i recommend to print the frames and the lid „upside down“ if you want to have a nice smooth finish where the panels go and the exact hight where the screws go.

For the assembly it's very important to put in the M3 nuts before screwing in the panels. Otherwise you'll get angry at yourself… For the not-strong-as-shit-variant you need nuts in every second hole. Look up the pics for further explanation. Also the DC-DC holders only need 2 Screws. For them you can use a washer to make sure the 10mm screw will not touch or even scratch the Panel.

After putting the nuts in the holes and putting the panels in the frames, you can start assembeling the cube by putting the panels an the corners together. After that you can put in the electric components and after that the two layers. The cube is designed in a way that you can put in the layers at the very last or to remove them without needing to disassemble the whole thing again.

if you have any further questions about the building or have some ideas how to make it better please send me a message on twitter @a_teddybar

until then have fun with the cube… :)
